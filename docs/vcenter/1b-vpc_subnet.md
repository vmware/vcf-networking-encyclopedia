This section describes the procedures for configuring a VPC Subnet using the vSphere Client.
<br><br>
**VPC Subnets** are Logical Subnets for workload (VMs / K8s) connection.
<br><br>
There are 2 types of VPC Subnets:

* [Overlay](#overlay)
* [VLAN](#vlan)

## VPC Subnet Overlay {: #overlay }

Tenant creates subnet-overlay and share to namespace



### Overview of Overlay Types
Different Subnet Overlay types are available:

| Type | Use Case | Routing Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Public** | Provide Public IPs to workloads with direct access to the physical network (No-NAT). | External visibility is high; direct ingress/egress. |
| **Private-TGW** | Provide Private IPs to workloads with no access to the physical network (requires [NAT](1c-vpc_nat.md)), but routably accessible to other VPCs in the same [Transit Gateway](3b-transit_gateway.md). | Best for shared internal services across the enterprise. |
| **Private-VPC** | Provide Private IPs to workloads with no access to the physical network and other VPCs in the same [Transit Gateway](3b-transit_gateway.md)   (requires [NAT](1c-vpc_nat.md)). | Maximum isolation; workloads are "hidden" even from other VPCs. |

### Configuration

* **Step1. Create new VPC Subnet (Overlay)**
    ![vCenter Create VPC](images/1b-1a-Create_VPC_Subnet.jpg){ width="70%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }

* **Step2. Configure new VPC Subnet**
    ![vCenter Create VPC](images/1b-1b-Create_VPC_Subnet.jpg){ width="90%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }

    * **VLAN Extensions**  
      "No" for a VPC-Subnet Overlay.  
      Note: VLAN Extension is detailed in a the section below.

    * **Access Mode**  
      Select VPC Subnet mode based (Public / Private TGW / Private VPC) based on the VM connectivity you need.

    * **IP Block**  
      Choose "Any", or select a specific IP Block for that VPC Subnet.

    * **Auto allocate Subnet CIDR from IP Blocks**  
      . "Yes" to let VCF Networking choose the VPC Subnet CIDR,  
      . "No" to choose manually the CIDR to use (you can see the "Available Ranges" when clicking on "View IPs..." - not showed in the screenshot).

    * **Subnet size**  
      Choose the number of IPs you'll need in that subnet to connect your workloads.  
      Keep in mind, 3 IP will be consumed by the VPC Gateway (subnet IP, default gateway, broadcast IP) + optionally a 4th IP if you enable DHCP Server.

    * **VPC Gateway Connectivity**  
      . "Yes": The VPC Subnet will be connected to the VPC Gateway and so workloads connected on that VPC Subnet will have access to outside of that VPC Subnet.  
      . "No": The VPC Subnet will NOT be connected to the VPC Gateway and so workloads connected on that VPC Subnet will NOT have access outside of that VPC Subnet.  

    * **DHCP Config**  
      . "None": No DHCP Service.  
      . "DHCP Server": VPC Subnet will have a DHCP Server to offer DHCP service to the workloads connected to that VPC Subnet.  
      . "DHCP Relay": VPC Gateway will forward DHCP requests for workloads connected to that VPC Subnet to an external DHCP Server.This option is not available if the VPC Gateway is connected to a Distributed Transit Gateway.

## VPC Subnet VLAN-Extension {: #vlan }

Org creates subnet-VLAN and share to Org
  => Subnet available in Tenant Subnets.
  then Tenant share to namespace
Note: That subnet-VLAN can be shared in multiple Orgs.


Org creates DTGW-VLAN-Dedicated and add "Dedicated VLAN Connection" to Org
  => DTGW available in Tenant.
  then Tenant adds that DTGW-VLAN-Dedicated to a VPC (public mode only)
Note: That subnet-VLAN can NOT be shared in multiple Orgs.


### Overview of VLAN Options
Different Subnet VLAN options are available:

| Type | Use Case | Routing Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **L2-Only** | Provides direct access to a physical VLAN. | Access to Public VPC Subnets is via the external network only. No access to Private VPC Subnets. |
| **Public - No VPC Connectivity** | The VPC Gateway is aware of the VLAN subnet, but provides no routing services to it. | In vCenter, this option provides the exact same functionality as the L2-Only mode (designed for VCF Automation). |
| **Public - VPC Connectivity** | Provides access to the physical VLAN via the VPC Gateway (bridges). | Enables simultaneous access to the Physical VLAN and internal Overlay VPC Subnets. |

![VPC Subnet VLAN Option](images/1b-0-VPC_Subnet_VLAN-Extension_Options.jpg){: .center style="width:80%" }

### Configuration

* **Step1. Create new VPC Subnet VLAN-Extension**
    ![vCenter Create VPC](images/1b-2a-Create_VPC_Subnet.jpg){ width="70%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }


* **Step2. Choose the VPC Subnet name + VLAN Extension + Access Mode + VLAN ID (+ Gateway IP + Connectivity)**
    ![vCenter Create VPC](images/1b-2b-Create_VPC_Subnet_VLAN.jpg){ width="70%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }

    * **VLAN Extensions**  
      "Yes" for a VPC-Subnet VLAN-Extension.  

    * **Access Mode**  
      Select Access Mode (L2-Only / Public - No VPC Connectivity / Public - VPC Connectivity) based on the VM connectivity you need.

    * **VLAN ID**  
      Enter the physical VLAN ID.

    * **Gateway CIDR IPv4 Address** (only for the Access Mode Public)  
      Enter the default gateway of that VLAN (configured in the physical network).

    * **VPC Gateway Connectivity** (only for the Access Mode Public)  
      . "No": The VPC Subnet VLAN-Extension will NOT be connected to the VPC Gateway, but directly to the physical VLAN.    
      . "Yes": The VPC Subnet VLAN-Extention will be connected to the VPC Gateway and bridged to the physical VLAN.

## Packet Walk - N/S External to VIP {: #packetwalk }
A Full Application (Load Balancer + Pods) has been deployed (see [Application Deployment > App Deployment (K8s) > via CLI](1f1-deployment-pods.md#deployment_pods)).

### Packet Walk

* **Step1: External Client accesses the VIP**  
`Client-IP => VIP:80 (10.1.11.15)`  

    The traffic enters the ESX hosting the FLB Node Active.

* **Step2: VIP load balances traffic to the K8s Worker Nodes (kube-proxy)**  
`VPC-SR-Internal-IP => K8s WorkerNode[1-3]:32176 (10.1.11.[x])`  

    The load balancer (FLB) forwards the traffic to the dynamically assigned NodePort on the K8s Worker Nodes.  
    If the Worker Nodes reside on a different ESX than the Active VPC-SR, the cross-ESX traffic is sent over the VLAN29 Dataplane.  

    *Note: You can find the dynamically assigned Worker Node TCP port (`32176`) by running the command `kubectl get service apache-vip-service -n ns1` and looking under the PORT(S) column (see [Application Deployment > App Deployment (K8s) > via CLI](1f1-deployment-pods.md#deployment_pods)).*

* **Step 3: The K8s Worker Node intercepts the traffic**  
    Once the traffic arrives at the Worker Node's network interface on the NodePort (`32176`), it is intercepted by the node's local routing rules (which are continuously programmed by the local `kube-proxy` pod).

* **Step 4 (not represented): The Worker Node load balances traffic to the Pods**  
    Based on those `kube-proxy` rules, the Worker Node load balances the traffic to the different pods across the K8s cluster.  
    See [Packet Walk - E/W pod to pod](1h3-packetwalk-pod_pod.md#packetwalk) for cross-pod communication.
